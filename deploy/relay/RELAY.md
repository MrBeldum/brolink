# BroLink relay

A BroLink stream is fastest when the two devices connect directly. When a strict NAT
or firewall blocks that, Tailscale falls back to a shared DERP server, which adds
latency and caps throughput. This kit turns a machine you own — a cheap cloud VPS is
ideal — into a **Tailscale peer relay**, so blocked streams go through your box
instead of DERP.

The order is Tailscale's own and needs no BroLink code: **direct → peer relay → DERP.**
DERP stays as the last-resort fallback. If the relay is down, streaming still works,
just at DERP quality.

**A relay only serves its own tailnet.** There is no shared BroLink relay and there
cannot be one: a peer relay can only relay for devices in the same tailnet as itself.
If you and a friend are on separate tailnets, each of you runs a relay for your own.

## Prerequisites

| | |
|---|---|
| Relay host | Any Linux box with a public IP. Not iOS/tvOS/Android. 1 vCPU is enough; bandwidth is what matters. |
| Docker | Engine with the `docker compose` plugin (v2). `docker-compose` v1 is not supported. |
| Kernel networking | `/dev/net/tun` present. The kit refuses userspace networking — it is too slow to relay. |
| No native tailscaled | The container uses host networking; a tailscaled installed on the host would fight it for the same interface. `install-relay.sh` refuses to run if it finds one. |
| Tailscale version | **1.86 or later on the relay and on every device that uses it.** Peer relay does not exist before 1.86; older clients silently stay on DERP. The entrypoint checks the relay's own version and refuses rather than pretending. |
| UDP port | One UDP port (default **40000**) reachable from the internet, open in **both** the host firewall and your cloud provider's security list, **IPv4 and IPv6**. |
| Tailnet role | Owner, Admin, or Network admin — you need to edit the policy file. |

## Install

```sh
cd deploy/relay
cp .env.example .env && chmod 600 .env
# put a reusable, NON-ephemeral auth key tagged tag:relay into .env
./install-relay.sh
```

`install-relay.sh` is idempotent — run it as many times as you like. It:

1. verifies docker, the compose plugin, `/dev/net/tun`, and the absence of a native tailscaled;
2. rejects a `RELAY_PORT` or `RELAY_WAIT_SECS` that is not a number in range **before**
   touching the firewall or starting anything, reading the values from
   `docker compose config` (what `up` will actually run with);
3. **stops with resume instructions if there is no `TS_AUTHKEY` and no already-authenticated
   node** — it does not start a half-configured relay;
4. inserts an `ACCEPT udp/<port>` rule *above* the distro's catch-all `REJECT` in `iptables`
   and `ip6tables`, re-reads the chain to confirm the rule is really reachable, and saves
   current rules with `netfilter-persistent` whenever that tool is installed (including a
   re-run after you install it);
5. starts the container and waits for the node to authenticate, printing the login URL if it needs one;
6. **waits for `RELAY CONFIG OK` in this container start's logs** (`docker logs --since
   StartedAt`, not a 50-line tail). A leftover port or an OK from a previous start is
   not success. If this start logged FAILED or nothing, it restarts **once** so a late
   login can apply prefs, then re-checks. A second failure exits non-zero.

**After the first successful login you can delete `TS_AUTHKEY` from `.env`.** The node's
identity lives in the `relay-state` volume, and `TS_AUTH_ONCE=true` means the key is only
consulted when there is no identity yet — so a re-run, a reboot or a `docker compose down
&& up` needs no key at all. Keeping a long-lived reusable key on disk forever is the
avoidable risk here.

Run `./selftest.sh` to exercise the installer's failure paths (bad port, prefs that never
land, a dead firewall rule below `REJECT`, a missing `ip6tables`, an authenticated node
with no key) against stubbed docker and iptables. It touches nothing outside a temp dir.

It never opens your cloud provider's security list — do that yourself, for UDP,
IPv4 and IPv6. And a firewall rule that has not survived a reboot is not done:
reboot the host and re-check `iptables -L INPUT --line-numbers`.

Rule *order* is what matters, not presence: `iptables -C` reports success for an
`ACCEPT` that sits below the catch-all `REJECT` and is therefore never reached. The
script compares line numbers, says so when it finds a dead rule, and inserts a
reachable one above the `REJECT` (leaving the dead duplicate alone — deleting rules
on someone else's firewall is not this script's business). If `iptables` or
`ip6tables` is missing it says which family was left closed instead of reporting
that both were opened.

## Policy file

Two pieces. Without the grant, the relay is a node like any other and nothing uses it.

```json
{
  "tagOwners": {
    "tag:relay": ["autogroup:admin"]
  },
  "grants": [
    {
      // Devices that may be reached through the relay.
      "src": ["autogroup:member"],
      // The relay itself.
      "dst": ["tag:relay"],
      "app": {
        // No parameters; the capability is the whole permission.
        "tailscale.com/cap/relay": []
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`src` is *not* "who may use the relay" — it is the set of devices that other devices
are allowed to reach *through* the relay. `autogroup:member` means "the devices in my
tailnet", which for a personal tailnet is what you want.

**Do not use `"src": ["*"]`.** `*` includes devices that have no business being
relayed and sends traffic on detours that make latency worse. If you want to be
stricter than `autogroup:member`, tag the PCs that host BroLink streams and narrow it:

```json
"src": ["tag:brolink-host"]
```

Tailscale's own guidance: `src` should be devices in a stable location behind a strict
NAT — a desktop at home, a cloud VM — rather than laptops and phones that roam.

## Verify

From another device on the tailnet, generate some traffic, then:

```sh
tailscale status | grep peer-relay
```

A relayed peer prints its connection type as `peer-relay` plus the endpoint:

```
100.x.y.z  hostname  user@  windows  active; peer-relay 203.0.113.9:40000:vni:123, tx 12345 rx 67890
```

`relay "tok"` (or any other DERP region code) means it is still on DERP. `direct`
means it never needed a relay at all — that is the best case, not a failure.
`tailscale ping <host>` shows the same path.

After a restart, allow time for peers to rediscover the relay. The container can
already be `Running` while traffic temporarily uses DERP. Generate traffic and
repeat the path check for up to two minutes; verify an actual `peer-relay` path,
not only a healthy container or saved relay preferences.

## Operations

The default tailnet name is `relay` (`TS_HOSTNAME` in `.env`). To rename an
existing node, update `.env`, run
`docker exec brolink-relay tailscale set --hostname=relay`, then
`docker compose up -d` to persist the container environment. This retains the
node identity, IP address, tags, and pairing.

**Identity survives restarts.** State lives in the `relay-state` named volume mounted
at `TS_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/tailscale`, and `TS_AUTH_ONCE=true` stops it re-logging in
on every boot. `docker compose down && docker compose up -d` keeps the same node — if
you ever see a second `relay` in the admin console, the volume was lost.
Deleting the volume is the only way to start over:
`docker compose down -v` (this forces a fresh login and a new node).

**Stale nodes after a re-login.** A `docker compose down -v` (or a `tailscale logout` inside
the container) leaves the previous node listed *offline* in the admin console, and the new
node may come up as `relay-1` because the old one still holds the plain name.
Nothing uses the offline node (no grant matches it, and BroLink only looks at `tag:relay`
nodes that are online), so it is cosmetic. Delete it on the Machines page; there is no CLI
for that. The live relay is whichever `relay*` row shows `tag:relay` and is online.

**Relay prefs survive restarts too** — `tailscale set` writes them into that same
state. The entrypoint re-applies them on every start anyway, which is what picks up a
new public IP after a stop/start on an instance without a reserved address.

**Changing the port:** edit `RELAY_PORT` in `.env`, re-run `./install-relay.sh` (it
opens the new port), then remove the old rule by hand. The relay picks the new port up
on restart.

**Turning it off:** `docker compose down`. Streams fall back to DERP by themselves.
To keep the node but stop relaying: `docker exec brolink-relay tailscale set --relay-server-port=""`.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `install-relay: no TS_AUTHKEY, and no authenticated state` | Expected on a first run. Nothing was started, nothing changed. Follow the printed steps. |
| `relay prefs did NOT take effect. RelayServerPort is 'unset'` | The container is up but not relaying. The script prints the configurator's own log lines underneath; look for `RELAY CONFIG FAILED`. Usual causes are the next two rows. |
| `RELAY_PORT='…' in .env is not a UDP port` | Nothing was changed. Fix the value; a trailing `# comment` is fine, anything non-numeric is not. |
| Container up, node `NeedsLogin` | The key was empty, expired, or single-use and already spent. `docker logs brolink-relay \| grep login.tailscale.com` for a manual login URL. |
| `Relay prefs NOT applied` in the logs | The node never authenticated inside `RELAY_WAIT_SECS`. Finish the login, then `docker restart brolink-relay`. |
| Node authenticates but peers still say `relay "xxx"` | The grant is missing, a peer is older than 1.86, or the UDP port is not actually reachable. Check the cloud security list, and `iptables -L INPUT --line-numbers` for a rule *above* `REJECT`. |
| Relay node disappears after a restart | The auth key was ephemeral. Create a non-ephemeral one. |
| `peer relay unavailable` at startup | The image is older than 1.86. Unpin or bump `TS_IMAGE`. |

## Files

| File | |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.yml` | The relay service: host networking, kernel networking, `/dev/net/tun`, `NET_ADMIN`/`NET_RAW`, named state volume. |
| `relay-entrypoint.sh` | Wraps the stock entrypoint. Waits for the backend to reach `Running`, then applies the relay port and static endpoint, and logs `RELAY CONFIG OK` or `RELAY CONFIG FAILED` so a background failure cannot pass silently. The official image has no relay setting and runs no user command, so this wrapper is the supported way to do it. |
| `selftest.sh` | Stub-driven regression tests for the installer's failure paths. No docker, no network, no root. |
| `.env.example` | Every knob, no secrets. Copy to `.env`. |
| `.env` | **Your auth key. Gitignored. Never commit it, never paste it into a shell with tracing on.** |
| `install-relay.sh` | Idempotent installer described above. |
