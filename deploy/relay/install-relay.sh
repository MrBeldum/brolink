		  2. Put it in $(pwd)/.env as TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-...
		     (.env is gitignored and now chmod 600; do not paste the key into a traced shell)
		  3. Add the peer-relay grant from RELAY.md to your tailnet policy file.

		Once the node has authenticated once you can delete the key from .env;
		re-runs use the persisted state instead.
