# Move a native Linux node from the names Latch had before 4.1.0 (when it was
# called BroLink) to the new ones. Run it as the user that owns the desktop,
# from this directory, after putting the new latch-host at /usr/local/bin:
#
#   sudo install -m 0755 latch-host /usr/local/bin/latch-host
#   bash migrate-from-brolink.sh
#
# It stops the old stack, swaps the user units, the display cookie name and
# the wait script, and starts the new one. The data folder (settings,
# pairing identity) and the engine's login are moved by latch-host itself the
# first time it runs, so nothing is copied here. Safe to run twice.
